# SBT_Programming_Assignment-II

In this Project I created a function who sort an array without using any mutable variable

Main concept:-
 
 Take Two list(because they are immutable) 
 First = Given array
 Second = Result in sorted array

 Extract the largest value from the Given array and add it from the head in the resultant array
 do it untill the given array become Nil.
